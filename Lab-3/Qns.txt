1. Implement a port scanner using socket programming. The port scanner checks a number of ports (for instance, from 1 to 1026) to see if they are open (a server is listening on that port number) or closed (a server is not listening on that port number)

2. Implementation of echo client and server model

3. Assume that there two servers, A and B, which store a 10MB file that is split into 10 parts. Client 1 requests the file to server A which replies to client 1 with 5 chunks of the requested file, which are randomly selected.  Later on, client 1 identifies the missing chunks and it requests the missing chunks (and only them) to server B. Moreover, the Client 1 can request 1 piece of chunk at the same. Once all the chunks are received, Client 1 sends the THANKS message to both of the servers.
