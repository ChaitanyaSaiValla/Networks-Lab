Simulate the Distance Vector Routing with randomly deployed 50 stations. Check for the Count â€“to-Infinity problem.  If it is not existing, then impose the problem and then implement any two solutions to resolve the Count-to-Infinity problem occurred in the routing protocol. Run the simulation for 100secs. Measure and plot the network performance in terms of PDR, PLR, routing overhead and route reconstruction rate for every 10sec interval.
